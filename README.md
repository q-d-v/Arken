# Arken
### What's this?
This is the official github for Arken, the game that *I'm currently making.*
### No, no, I mean, what's Arken?
Arken is a game where a white square (named "Thing", great name, I know) recieves the ability to shift between two realities. Thing uses said ability to progress through the empty world it woke up in.
### Cool. But why does it have a GitHub page? Can't you just upload it to itch.io or other services?
...Next question?
I'm joking. I just don't think it's the time to publish the game to itch. The game doesn't even have a PROPER story yet. Maybe in the future.
